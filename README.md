# CyberPatriot ScoreBoard Round Total
A little program to calculate the placement of my team from both Round 1 and Round 2 as a cummulative score to determine our placement within the bracket. The actual organization is taking a little bit of time to release the cummulative scores of both Round 1 and Round 2, so I decided to make this.

## What's Included?
- A main Python file that calculates the cummulative score from two spreadsheets and returns the ranking of a team.
- A spreadsheet generator for the [CyberPatriot scoreboard](https://scoreboard.uscyberpatriot.org/) in the style of the organization's other spreadsheets.
